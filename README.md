## About the project.
Redly in cooperation with Bake'sell, has created an application that allows you to trade cakes and other sweet preserves. The whole design was to be based on candy colors and graphics. The interface has been designed for quick and intuitive operations. Additionally, the agency designed advertising banners in two sizes.
